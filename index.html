                Commits are the groups of code that will be pushed to a branch in
                Git and can help you keep track of changes made to a project.

            <h2>Merge</h2>
            <p>
                Once a new branch is finished you can merge it to the main branch.

                Rebasing rewrites history to get the commits in one branch, resulting
                in a clean commit history.
